- Hi I'm Jon Caleb I'm 17 years old as of 2022 and I'm a self taught software engineer!
- Currently my coding skillset consists of Python, HTML/CSS, JavaScript.
- Other than coding, my skillset includes making music, designing pixel art sprites, public speaking/communication,
- and problem solving, I have a knack for needing stack-overflow way less than most developers do, and providing useful insight
- into issues, coding or otherwise.
- My roadmap until I graduate in 2023 is to learn these things below,
- C++, C, SQL and postgreSQL, NodeJS, JQuery, machine learning, data science, and cybersecurity.

- Some things I aspirations of mine are as follows, 
- to get a job as a software engineer not just a webdev, (although I'll gladly work as a webdev),
- to help poor communities have better access to the hardware necessary to have technology as a career path,
- contribute new ideas and discoveries to the computer-science comunity throughout my life.

- Some of my interests are listening and creating music, playing video games, long-boarding, coding(obviously), sports, doing crossfit with friends,
- preaching the gospel, and watching movies and shows, my favorite movie is any of the three Lord of the Rings movies.
