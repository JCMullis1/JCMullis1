Hi, I'm Jon Caleb I'm 18 years old as of 2023 and I'm a self-taught software engineer!
- My coding skillset consists of Python, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, C, and CPP.
  Other than coding, my skillset includes making music, designing pixel art sprites, public speaking/communication,
- and problem solving, I have a knack for needing stack-overflow way less than most developers do and providing useful insight
  into issues, coding, or otherwise.

Some aspirations of mine are as follows, 
- to get a job as a software engineer not just a web dev, (although I'll gladly work as a web dev),
- to help poor communities have better access to the hardware necessary to have technology as a career path,
- and to contribute new ideas and discoveries to the computer-science community throughout my life.

Some of my interests are 
- listening and creating music, playing video games, long-boarding, coding(obviously), sports, doing CrossFit with friends,
- preaching the gospel, and watching movies and shows, my favorite movie is any of the three Lord of the Rings movies.
